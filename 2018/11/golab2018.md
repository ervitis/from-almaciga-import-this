# GoLab 2018

The GoLab meeting held in Firenze in October. It was the first time since I joined X by Orange I went to an international 
conference about Go called [GoLab](https://www.golab.io/)

At the meeting we learnt a lot of good stuff from other Gophers. In this first entry of this blog I resume some of them.

- [Gobot](https://gobot.io/) and [GoCV](https://gocv.io/) two great projects for IoT world. Ron Evans showed that Go could  
  be fit too in that world.
  
- The dark side off the rutines, performed by Roberto Clapis told us some problems about concurrency and parallelism tasks 
  in Go.
  
- Decoding base64 with states machines, performed by Anna Bernardi. A great talk where I remembered all about states machines 
  from my campus live.
  
- Building an API using gRPC by Paweł Słomka. A great talk where I learnt how you can build APIs and your messages using 
  protobuffer without suffering!
  
- [Orchestration of microservices](https://www.slideshare.net/BerndRuecker/gophercon-uk-2018-orchestration-of-microservices) by 
  Berned Ruecker. It's great building microservices, but the problem with it in businness logic is how they should interact 
  between them. This talk was about building a BPMN process using Camunda.
  
- Enhace the performance of your Go application, by Bill Kennedy. At that talk I was really impressed how you can increase 
  the performance of your Go code using the Trace package and measuring the CPU and memory usage.
  
- Build a proxy modifyng the TCP layer, performed by Filippo Valsorda. He showed us how to play with the tcp layer using 
  Go and build a proxy to redirect the network.
